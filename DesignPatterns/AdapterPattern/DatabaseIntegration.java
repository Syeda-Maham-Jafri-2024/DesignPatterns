// You are developing a modern application that needs to integrate with a legacy database system using a proprietary API. The 
// application expects data in a standardized format. Your goal is to seamlessly integrate the legacy database, allowing the 
// application to work with it without modifying its existing code.

// Requirements:

// Integrate the legacy database into the modern application without modifying the legacy code.
// Ensure that the application can perform standard database operations such as querying and updating.
// The integration should not disrupt the existing functionalities of the modern application.
// Challenges:

// Accommodate the differences in data formats and APIs between the modern application and the legacy database.
// Design the integration to be flexible enough to add new database systems in the future.
// Tasks:

// Identify the design pattern that best addresses the challenges and requirements outlined in this scenario.
// Implement the necessary class or classes for the chosen design pattern to facilitate the integration.
// Provide code snippets demonstrating how the modern application interacts with the legacy database using the chosen pattern.
