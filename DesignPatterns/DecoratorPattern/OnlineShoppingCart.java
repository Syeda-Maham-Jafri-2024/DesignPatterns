// You are working on an online shopping cart system that allows users to add products to their cart 
// and apply various discounts and promotions. The system needs to support different types of discounts,
// such as percentage-based discounts, fixed amount discounts, and buy-one-get-one-free promotions.

// Requirements:
// Implement a decorator pattern to enhance the shopping cart's discount and promotion capabilities.
// Products should be the base components, and decorators should represent different types of discounts and promotions.
// Users should be able to apply multiple discounts and promotions to a single product.
// It should be possible to introduce new types of discounts and promotions without modifying existing code.

// Challenges:
// Ensure that the decorator pattern allows for the dynamic combination of multiple discounts and promotions.
// Design the system to handle the calculation of final prices with various combinations of discounts.

// Tasks:
// Identify the design pattern that best addresses the challenges and requirements outlined in this scenario.
// Implement the necessary classes for the chosen design pattern to enable flexible application of discounts and promotions in the shopping cart.
// Provide code snippets demonstrating how users can apply various discounts and promotions to products using the decorator pattern.
