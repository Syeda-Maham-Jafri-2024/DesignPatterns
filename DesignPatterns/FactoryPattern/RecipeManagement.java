// You are building a recipe management system that allows users to create and organize recipes for various cuisines. Each recipe may consist of different ingredients, steps, and cooking methods. New recipe types may be introduced in the future without modifying the existing code.

// Requirements:

// There should be a central recipe factory responsible for creating instances of different recipe types.
// The recipe factory should provide methods to create recipes with various components, such as ingredients, steps, and cooking times.
// Each recipe type may have specific methods for preparation and cooking.
// The system must support the addition of new recipe types without requiring changes to existing code.
// Recipes should be created based on user preferences and dietary restrictions.
// Challenges:

// The recipe management system must handle variations in ingredients and cooking methods for different cuisines.
// It should be possible to create recipes with different nutritional information and serving sizes.
// Tasks:

// Identify the design pattern that best addresses the challenges and requirements outlined in this scenario.
// Implement the necessary class or classes for the chosen design pattern to ensure flexible recipe creation.
// Provide code snippets demonstrating how different parts of the application can create instances of recipes using the factory method pattern.
